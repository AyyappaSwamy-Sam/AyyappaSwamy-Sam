# Hi 👋, I'm Ayyappa Swamy

**Backend & AI Engineer | System Architect**

I specialize in designing and deploying scalable **Generative AI applications** and **multi-agent systems**. I take a hands-on approach to the entire lifecycle of a project—from conceptualizing system architecture and building AI pipelines to managing cloud infrastructure and ensuring network security.

Currently, I'm focused on engineering high-performance analytics engines that leverage LLMs and asynchronous architectures to solve complex data challenges.

### 🚀 Technical Focus & Skills

- **Generative AI & Multi-Agents:** Architecting production-ready workflows using **LangGraph**, **Google Gemini**, and **OpenAI**. I focus on intent-driven multi-agent systems and Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **System Design & Backend:** Engineering high-concurrency systems with **FastAPI** and **Go**. I prefer **DuckDB** for sub-second OLAP queries and **PostgreSQL/MongoDB** for robust data persistence.
- **Cloud & Security (Self-Managed):** Full ownership of my **GCP** environments (Cloud Run, GKE). I manage my own **Ubuntu VPS** hardening, network security, and IP-based fraud prevention protocols.
- **Data Engineering:** Designing sophisticated ingestion pipelines and modeling complex relationships using **Neo4j (GraphRAG)** and **Vector Databases** (Milvus, Chroma).
