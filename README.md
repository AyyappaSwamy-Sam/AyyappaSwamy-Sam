# Hi 👋, I'm Ayyappa Swamy

**Backend & AI Engineer | System Architect**

I specialize in designing, deploying, and securing scalable **Generative AI applications** and **multi-agent systems**. I'm passionate about building high-performance systems from the ground up—from designing the core architecture and AI pipelines to managing the cloud infrastructure and security.

### 🚀 Technical Focus

- **GenAI & Multi-Agent Systems:** Building production-ready pipelines with **LangGraph**, **Google Gemini**, and **OpenAI**. Specialized in Advanced RAG and intent-driven workflows.
- **High-Performance Architecture:** Engineering sub-second analytics engines using **FastAPI**, **Go**, and **DuckDB** (OLAP) to handle large-scale data processing.
- **Infrastructure & Security:** Full-stack ownership of **GCP** environments (Cloud Run, GKE, Kubernetes). I handle my own VPS hardening, network security (Ubuntu), and deployment lifecycles.
- **Data Engineering:** Designing complex data ingestion pipelines, using **Vector Databases** (Milvus, Chroma) and **Graph Databases** (Neo4j) for GraphRAG.
